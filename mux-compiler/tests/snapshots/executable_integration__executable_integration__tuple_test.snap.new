Running tuple tests...

Test 1: Basic primitives
  Created tuple: (42, hello)
  t1.left = 42
  t1.right = hello

Test 2: Float, bool, char
  Created float tuple
  t_float.left = 3.14
  Created bool tuple
  t_bool.left = true
  Created char tuple
  t_char.left = a

Test 3: Nested tuples
  Created nested tuple
  nested.left.left = 1
  nested.right.right = b

Test 4: to_string
  t.to_string() = (1, two)

Test 5: Custom class with tuple
  Created Point with x=1.0, y=2.0
  Created tuple from fields
  pt.left = 1.0
  pt.right = 2.0

Test 6: Collections with tuples
  Created list of tuples
  tuple_list[0].left = 1
  tuple_list[0].right = a

All tuple tests completed!
