Running tuple tests...

Test 1: Basic primitives
  Created tuple: (42, hello)
  t1.left = 42 (should be 42)
  t1.right = hello (should be hello)
  Created empty tuple: (0, "")
  empty.left = 0 (should be 0)
  empty.right =  (should be empty)

Test 2: Float, bool, char
  Created float tuple
  t_float.left = 3.14 (should be 3.14)
  Created bool tuple
  t_bool.left = true (should be true)
  Created char tuple
  t_char.left = a (should be a)

Test 3: Nested tuples
  Created nested tuple
  nested.left.left = 1 (should be 1)
  nested.right.right = b (should be b)
  Created triple nested tuple
  triple_nested.left.right.left = 3 (should be 3)
  triple_nested.right.left.right = y (should be y)
  Created mixed nested tuple
  mixed_nested.left.left.right = a (should be a)
  mixed_nested.left.right.right = z (should be z)
  mixed_nested.right.left.left = 3.5 (should be 3.5)

Test 4: to_string
  t.to_string() = (1, two) (should be (1, two))

Test 5: Custom class with tuple
  Created Point with x=1.0, y=2.0
  Created tuple from fields
  pt.left = 1.0 (should be 1.0)
  pt.right = 2.0 (should be 2.0)

Test 6: Collections with tuples
  Created list of tuples
  tuple_list[0].left = 1 (should be 1)
  tuple_list[0].right = a (should be a)
  Created list of nested tuples
  nested_tuple_list[1].left.right = 4 (should be 4)
  nested_tuple_list[0].right.left = a (should be a)
  Created tuple with list and tuple
  tuple_with_list.left[2] = 3 (should be 3)
  tuple_with_list.right.left = x (should be x)

All tuple tests completed!
