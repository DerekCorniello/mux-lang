# Language Reference

This section provides detailed, technical documentation of Mux's syntax and semantics.

## Purpose

The Language Reference is the authoritative source for:
- Exact syntax definitions
- Semantic behavior
- Edge cases and corner cases
- Implementation details

This is different from the [Language Guide](../language-guide/index.md), which focuses on teaching and examples.

## Contents

<!-- TODO: Add reference pages as the language stabilizes -->

Coming soon:
- **Lexical Structure** - Tokens, keywords, identifiers
- **Grammar** - Formal syntax definitions
- **Type System** - Complete type rules and inference
- **Operators** - Precedence, associativity, behavior
- **Statements** - Detailed semantics of each statement type
- **Expressions** - Expression evaluation rules
- **Memory Model** - Reference counting specifics
- **ABI** - Binary interface for external interop

## Current Status

The Mux language is still evolving. As such, this reference section is under development.

For now, please refer to:
- [Language Guide](../language-guide/index.md) - Practical language documentation
- [README.md](https://github.com/derekcorniello/mux-lang/blob/main/README.md) - Comprehensive language specification
- [Source Code](https://github.com/derekcorniello/mux-lang) - The compiler itself is the ultimate reference

## Contributing

If you find discrepancies between documentation and implementation, please [file an issue](https://github.com/derekcorniello/mux-lang/issues).
